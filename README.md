# image-removing outliers-with-KNN
numpy for numerical operations.
skimage.io to read and write images.
sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors for the KNN algorithm.
matplotlib.pyplot for displaying images.
The code begins by loading an image from the specified path using io.imread from skimage.
The image is reshaped into a 2D array where each row represents a pixel and its color channels. The shape of the original image (rows x cols x channels) is converted to a 2D array of shape (rows*cols, channels).
A NearestNeighbors model is created with n_neighbors set to 10.
The model is fitted with the flattened image data.
It computes distances between each point and its n_neighbors nearest neighbors.
A threshold distance is calculated based on the mean of the furthest distances multiplied by 2.
Pixels that have maximum distances smaller than the threshold are considered as non-outliers and their indices are collected.
Pixels identified as non-outliers are used to filter the flattened image data.
The filtered data might be smaller than the original image after removing outliers, so padding is applied to match the original shape.
The filtered flattened array is reshaped back into the original image dimensions (rows x cols x channels).
The resulting filtered image is displayed using plt.imshow, turning off axis labels, setting a title, and showing the image using plt.show().
In summary, this code takes an image, uses KNN to identify and remove outlier pixels based on their distances from their neighbors, and then displays the filtered image where outliers have been removed.
